precious time on building something for myself. I found a co-founder and start building my first SaaS: UptimeMate<p>We did a small announcement in early February, and the interest was great. We received over four hundred sign-ups. Don&#x27;t know if that is much, but it felt great!<p>But then the covid-19 happened, and priorities shifted. My co-founder and I had to make sure that our families were safe and that we had an income during the crisis. Bills must be paid and UptimeMate is a bootstrapped project, so we had to make a difficult decision to push the launch forward.<p>Now things on the covid-19 front are settling down in our region, we felt that now is a suitable time to give them access to our beta.<p>This is a huge deal for us, and we are scared and excited at the same time. To give people access to our project where we have put all our free time in for the last 6 months.<p>We decided that we have the beta until September 1. Is a 2&#x2F;3-month period normal for a beta?

Our beta is free for everybody.

As such, the owners are responsible for their maintenance, safety, and security.
